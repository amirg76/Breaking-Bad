Code and document for the Breaking Bad Fan's Tv Show App With Api's.

This is project that made in appleSeeds bootCamp.

## How I Build The Project

I use REACT to build the project.

I use ALOTE OF REACT COMPONENTS to handle the data,
build the MAIN STATE that i need for connect and render,
the data from the componments to the html.

I use 4 methods with the API: GET,POST,DELETE AND PUT(CRUD).

I use REACT ROUTER to handle page routing.

I use REACT HOOKS like USEREF,USEEFFECT,USECONTEXT.

I use REACT COMPONENTS STYLE fontawsome, for the navbar.

## I Use 3 API:

- https://www.breakingbadapi.com/api
- https://online-movie-database.p.rapidapi.com/title
- MOKEAPI to use CRUD.

### What Languege I Use

- I made it with CSS AND JAVA-SCRIPT AND REACT.
- I use a lot of method and separate the code
- to different files.

- REACT COMPONENTS
- REACT ROUTER
